# Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to uncover key insights into crop production, environmental impact, and input efficiency across different regions and climatic conditions.
By analyzing historical agricultural data from 1993 to 2013, the project seeks to identify yield trends, regional performance,
and the relationship between climate variables and crop output. 
The ultimate goal is to provide data-driven recommendations that support climate-resilient agriculture, inform policy decisions, and guide investment in sustainable farming practices.

- Optimal yield zones are found in regions with moderate temperatures (15¬∞C‚Äì23¬∞C) and stable rainfall pattern(1000mm - 1999mm). 

- Potato is the most resilient crops under varying temperature and rainfall conditions followed by Sweet Potato and Cassava. 

- Excessive heat above 30¬∞C leads to yield declines across all crops, highlighting the need for climate-smart planning.
  
- Yield drops by 20‚Äì35% under cold stress (10¬∞C‚Äì15¬∞C). High rainfall (>1999mm) zones face yield decline due to poor drainage.  

- High pesticide use does not always correlate with higher yields, indicating inefficiencies in input allocation.  

- Input optimization and crop-location alignment can significantly boost yield potential, even under suboptimal climate conditions.

# 4. Insights Deep Dive 

 

### üå± Crop Overview Dashboard 

Our overall yield inreased steadily driven primarily by Root and tuber crops like Potato, Sweet Potato, and Cassava lead in productivity, showing strong responsiveness to inputs and adaptability to current conditions. Cereal crops like Maize, Rice, and Wheat yield less overall as compared to roots and tubers but display a steady upward trend. 
Plantain and Sorghum remain stable but underperforming. Plantain exhibited noticeable fluctuations from year to year.
Sorghum remained largely stable with only slight fluctuations and a slow increase in yield while Soybean stands out as the lowest yielding crop contributing 2.4% 
but remains important in specific regions.

### üåç Environmental Impact Analysis

 

 * From our 20years yield analysis, total crop yield increased steadily alongside a gradual rise in average temperature. While temperature showed slight year-to-year fluctuations, the  
   overall trend aligned with yield growth. This suggests a positive correlation between temperature and yield during this period but it does not prove that temperature caused yield to 
   rise, possibly due to adaptation strategies, improved agricultural inputs, or resilient crop varieties.

* Crop performance is highest under ideal temperature conditions, with potato, sweet potato, and cassava leading in yield. Warm and cool stress conditions reduce yield, though potato 
  remains relatively resilient. However, under excessively hot temperatures, all crops show a sharp decline in productivity, highlighting the vulnerability of current crop varieties to 
  extreme heat.

* Potato is the most resilient and efficient crop across all rainfall categories. It consistently leads in yield, especially in Optimal (1000mm - 1999mm) and Moderate(500mm - 999mm) 
  rainfall conditions and still performs relatively well even under Drought Risk (<499mm), suggesting exceptional water-use efficiency and adaptability.
  This positions Potato as a highly reliable crop for varying climate conditions. 
* Cassava and sweet potato also show strong performance, particularly under Optimal rainfall. However, cassava yield declines sharply in Moderate and Drought Risk zones, while Sweet 
  Potato maintains relatively stable output, indicating better tolerance to changing rainfall patterns. Their performance contrasts sharply with cereal crops like Maize, Rice, Wheat, 
  and Soybean, which receive Optimal rainfall but deliver consistently low yields. This can be because of uneven distribution of rainfall. 
* In Flood Risk zones, all crops underperform significantly, highlighting the detrimental effect of excess water on productivity.
  Additionally, Sorghum and Soybeans record persistently low yields across rainfall categories reflecting possible water stress. 
  
 

* While countries within the Optimal rainfall range (1000‚Äì1999 mm) generally achieve the highest agricultural productivity, our analysis shows that rainfall volume alone does not 
  determine yield outcomes. In drought-prone regions, while countries recorded low yield, countries like Pakistan with rainfall pattern (494mm) outperform peers through irrigation and 
  climate-smart practices. Similarly, Mexico and Australia thrive under moderate rainfall (500mm ‚Äì 999mm) due to strong agricultural infrastructure, while Indonesia with rainfall 
  pattern (2702mm) proves that high yields are still possible in flood-prone areas with the right crop selection and water management. This emphasizes that effective adaptation 
  strategies are just as important as environmental conditions.

### üåé Regional Analysis 

 

üåç Top Yield Contributors Drive Global Output 

India contributes the highest to global yield (‚âà38%), primarily due to its strong performance in Cassava, followed by Potato and Sweet Potato. 

Brazil and Mexico contributing 19% and 15% respectively also play key roles, with Brazil‚Äôs yield led by Potato, and Mexico showing balanced yield across Potato, Sweet Potato, and Cassava. 

Japan and Australia put up 14% and 13% respectively maintain strong productivity, especially in Potato and Sweet Potato. 

This suggest that countries in the Tropical and Temperate regions attain high productivity in crops. 

Countries like Namibia, Sudan, Montenegro, Eritrea, and Botswana show consistently low yields across most crops. The least producing countries are mostly located in Africa 

due to limited mechanization, input access or climatic political instability.

### üíß Input Usage & Efficiency Dashboard 

> ![Input Usage Dashboard](#)   

> Potato which accounted for the largest share of pesticide used at 13.13% showed a strong positive response to pesticide application, with higher pesticide use correlating with significantly higher yields. 
Sweet potato and cassava contributing 10.89% and 8.62% respectively also benefited, but their total yields remained moderate, suggesting limited productivity despite pesticide investment. 

Low Responsiveness in Cereals Despite High Pesticide Use. Cereal crops like Wheat, Maize, Sorghum and Rice putting up 13%, 12.9%, 10.6% and 11.95% respectively displayed little or no yield improvement with increased pesticide use. 
Despite receiving moderate to high pesticide applications, these crops delivered stagnant yield patterns. 

Overuse of pesticides and fertilizer in low-yield zones suggests input misallocation.  

But there is an untapped yield potential in Plantain since it received the lowest pesticide input at just 0.40% and also recorded the lowest yield. 

 

### üåø Crop Recommendation & Climate Planning Dashboard 

> ![Crop Recommendation Dashboard](#)   

> - **Optimal Rainfall Zones:** Promote Potato, Sweet Potato, and Cassava. 

> - **Drought/Heat-Stressed Areas:** Focus on Sweet Potato & Cassava with mulching & drip systems. 

> - **Flood Zones:** Promote rice and flood-tolerant varieties of Potato and Sweet Potato. 

> - **General:** Recommend heat-tolerant crop breeding and calendar shifts for temperature-exposed areas.
